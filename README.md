Not just any repository

Hello there, to everyone who will be visiting my git in present and future you all are welcome here.
Though I am new here and have been learning stuff on how to's on Git, will surely make a few good repositories until then you all will have to wait.
As for me, I am into a lot of stuff, don't worry you'll see that bright side as well. 
Let's do it..........
